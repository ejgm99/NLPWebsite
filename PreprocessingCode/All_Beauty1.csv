5.0,"This was a good story of the Black leagues. I bought the book to teach in my high school reading class. I found it very informative and exciting.

5.0,"Today I gave a book about the Negro Leagues of Baseball to a traveling friend. Its a book I've read more than once and felt that my friend would truly enjoy. It felt like giving a gift that you wanted to keep for yourself. I parted with the book knowing that my friend would enjoy reading it on his journey back east. Before giving him the book I spent about thirty minutes flipping through its pages and saying goodbye to some of the stories in it. I know I'll come across the book again, but for me, parting with books is like wishing a friend well on a journey, just as this friend of mine was journeying. Its great to send a visiting friend off with a friendly gift.

Well, in leafing through the book's pages I came across a few paragraphs I wanted to retain as a memory of my friend the book. Here below are the book and the lines from it that show in words what the negro baseball players faced every day of their lives; a color barrier that prevented them from gaining national sports recognition as professionals of the game they loved so much, baseball. Though Negro men had proven themselves heroic, capable of soldiering bravely in foreign battles of World War II, America was still treating them as second class citizens or less here at home. Major League Baseball would lead the nation in recovering from its racial prejudicial past. The nation today, even with a Black President, is still playing catch up.

4.0,"The story of race relations in American history is one of lost opportunity.  This concise history of the Negro Baseball Leagues for young adult readers illustrates this basic point.  The book discusses the names, dates, and circumstances of the major figures and events of the flip side of American baseball history. Legendary names such as Josh Gibson, ""Cool Papa"" Bell, and Satchel Page are just a few of the remarkable players who made important contributions to the game.  Among others, they played for teams with names such as The Homestead Grays, The St. Louis Stars, and The Kansas City Monarchs.  The book also tells the story of owners and managers, such names as Negro National League founder Rube Foster and the tough as nails woman owner of the Newark Eagles, Effa Manley spring to mind.  The book also briefly explains how the infamous Jim Crow tradition brought about the Negro Baseball saga.  In 1947, major league baseball was sucessfully integrated and that spelled the doom of the Negro Baseball leagues.  The text includes an ample number of photographs.  To assist younger readers, and for easy reference purposes, a player profile and time line section is provided at the back of the book.  Underlying the historical text, there is the theme that segregated baseball mirrored the nagging problem of racism in America.  A sense of fair play and even-handed justice demands that talent, skill, and just plain style should be celebrated, regardless of race.  To do otherwise cheats everybody of a rewarding experience.  Imagine if the great players of the Negro Baseball Leagues had the chance to play (with or against) the great players of the major leagues.  Consider the void created by lost opportunity.  ;-)","Baseball, America, and racism.","['story', 'race', 'relation', 'american', 'history', 'one', 'lose', 'opportunity', 'concise', 'history', 'negro', 'baseball', 'league', 'young', 'adult', 'reader', 'illustrate', 'basic', 'point', 'book', 'discusse', 'name', 'date', 'circumstance', 'major', 'figure', 'event', 'flip', 'side', 'american', 'baseball', 'history', 'legendary', 'name', 'josh', 'gibson', 'cool', 'papa', 'bell', 'satchel', 'page', 'remarkable', 'player', 'make', 'important', 'contribution', 'game', 'among', 'other', 'play', 'team', 'name', 'homestead', 'grays', 'st', 'louis', 'star', 'kansas', 'city', 'monarchs', 'book', 'also', 'tell', 'story', 'owner', 'manager', 'name', 'negro', 'national', 'league', 'founder', 'rube', 'foster', 'tough', 'nail', 'woman', 'owner', 'newark', 'eagle', 'effa', 'manley', 'spring', 'mind', 'book', 'also', 'briefly', 'explain', 'infamous', 'jim', 'crow', 'tradition', 'bring', 'negro', 'baseball', 'saga', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'sucessfully', 'integrate', 'spell', 'doom', 'negro', 'baseball', 'league', 'text', 'include', 'ample', 'number', 'photograph', 'assist', 'young', 'reader', 'easy', 'reference', 'purpose', 'player', 'profile', 'time', 'line', 'section', 'provide', 'back', 'book', 'underlie', 'historical', 'text', 'theme', 'segregated', 'baseball', 'mirror', 'nag', 'problem', 'racism', 'america', 'sense', 'fair', 'play', 'evenhanded', 'justice', 'demand', 'talent', 'skill', 'plain', 'style', 'celebrate', 'regardless', 'race', 'otherwise', 'cheat', 'everybody', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'imagine', 'great', 'player', 'negro', 'baseball', 'league', 'chance', 'play', 'great', 'player', 'major', 'league', 'consider', 'void', 'create', 'lose', 'opportunity']"

I also would've liked to see more than one or two pages of Aisling illustrations.

I prefer, however, a brush to be held far above the comb near the end of the brush handle.  (Most pictures of brush stands show them holding the brush at the comb, but I think that looks weird and top-heavy.  Call me weird, then.)  The arms are too narrow for the Omega.  I have a tool for opening / closing links of chain and I used it, but the result was a very wide V shape and I didn't want to put the somewhat fragile plastic handle in position while I used the tool to squeeze the V shape into more of a C shape.  So I put it back into its original shape.  Ill save as its a very good stand, and if I get a brush that will work the way I want to suspend the brush, I certainly will use this.

In  the meantime, what then to do with one's razor and, more importantly, one's shaving brush which must be stored with the bristles facing downward so the knot does not get ruined from getting soaked?  Also, this unit is rather tall, so it will not easily fit into a cabinet recess or on a cabinet shelf.

5.0,"This stand is just perfect. It looks great, and the construction is solid, but not it's uncomfortably heavy to lift. It's balanced, so that if you have a heavy safety razor on the one side (like my Merkur 34C, for example), and no brush on the other, the stand is perfectly stable. (Then again, shaving brushes aren't exactly heavy, are they? They are not. The point is, you don't have to worry about it tipping it over if you don't have a brush yet. And if you don't have a brush yet, you should consider getting one of those next!) But I do in fact store one of my badger-hair brushes on the other side (the German-made one, of course!), and it stays in place pretty well. Much more satisfying than those little plastic stands a lot of brushes come with. The patterned steel in the middle of the stand is also an attractive element, adding visual interest and complementing the similar texture of the razor handle.

4.0,"I bought this as a gift to add to the quality shaving brush and other shaving products for my son in law.  I selected it among several on the market and examined it carefully after receiving it. It is exactly what I had hoped for, namely, solid chromed metal, enough weight not to be tippy, able to be screwed apart, hopefully rustproof...we'll see...and able to hold the brush and razor purchased separately.  I might have given it 4 stars if I had been able to use it myself.  If my son-in-law likes it, I'll get this one also for myself as I now have a quality brush given to me in a package of creams, etc., but without a stand.  After only a month of enjoying lathering with a brush, I see that it is definitely necessary to have a stand to hang it upside down to allow water not to sit in and on the handle to eventually corrode the handle and the brush hairs at their base.

5.0,"I just got into wet shaving.  I decided to invest a little money into it and buy some nicer stuff than just the basic starter kit.  I purchased the Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor and the Escali Badger Hair brush and this stand to hold them.  It is a basic stand and it looks nice and feels sturdy.  The base is pretty heavy, which keeps it upright when the brush and razor are resting on it.  The Perfect Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand hold the Escali and Merkur perfectly.  Since both of these items are very popular, this stand is a nice complement to both items.

5.0,"I bought this stand shortly after changing from canned shaving cream to a beaver brush system to help preserve the brush.  It is a very solid, well constructed hanger for both the brush and some razors.  The razor hanging side does not work for my particular razor (Mach 3 which is a rather dated design by a major manufacturer) but the brush holder is a must to help keep you beaver brush rinsed clean and allowed to dry.  The product comes with instructions for disassembly and thorough cleaning of the stand which I really appreciate.  The fact that it does not hold my particular razor does not cause me any real concern because, due to the number of different razor designs on the market these days, I doubt that it is possible to design a system that could work for every conceivable razor on the market.  Who knows, I may change razors next?
My primary use for this stand from the start was to keep the beaver brush clean and to allow it to dry thoroughly between uses and it performs admirably for that purpose.  In addition it is well made and based on the quality of construction I anticipate that the finish and the stand will hold up for several years of everyday use.  I took the time to write this because I was impressed with the overall quality which I find to be a rarity these days.",Pleasantly Suprised by the Sturdy Design and Overall Quality,"['buy', 'stand', 'shortly', 'change', 'can', 'shaving', 'cream', 'beaver', 'brush', 'system', 'help', 'preserve', 'brush', 'solid', 'well', 'construct', 'hanger', 'brush', 'razor', 'razor', 'hang', 'side', 'work', 'particular', 'razor', 'mach', 'rather', 'date', 'design', 'major', 'manufacturer', 'brush', 'holder', 'must', 'help', 'keep', 'beaver', 'brush', 'rinse', 'clean', 'allow', 'dry', 'product', 'come', 'instruction', 'disassembly', 'thorough', 'clean', 'stand', 'really', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'hold', 'particular', 'razor', 'cause', 'real', 'concern', 'due', 'number', 'different', 'razor', 'design', 'market', 'day', 'doubt', 'possible', 'design', 'system', 'could', 'work', 'every', 'conceivable', 'razor', 'market', 'know', 'may', 'change', 'razor', 'next', 'primary', 'use', 'stand', 'start', 'keep', 'beaver', 'brush', 'clean', 'allow', 'dry', 'thoroughly', 'use', 'perform', 'admirably', 'purpose', 'addition', 'well', 'make', 'base', 'quality', 'construction', 'anticipate', 'finish', 'stand', 'hold', 'several', 'year', 'everyday', 'use', 'take', 'time', 'write', 'impress', 'overall', 'quality', 'find', 'rarity', 'day']"
